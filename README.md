# LibreDiary
**LibreDiary** is a premier open-source, local-first workspace designed for complete data sovereignty. Built with **Vue 3** and **Vuestic UI**, it transforms fragmented notes into a unified knowledge base using a high-performance, block-based interface.

Unlike cloud-dependent tools, **LibreDiary** is engineered for self-hosting, ensuring your information remains private and accessible offline. It features a robust **CRDT-powered sync engine** for real-time collaboration, a polymorphic storage layer supporting everything from local disks to S3-compatible buckets, and an enterprise-grade SSO system with domain-lockdown capabilities.

Whether you are organizing a solo project or scaling a team, **LibreDiary** provides a distraction-free environment that balances extensibility with effortless deployment. It is more than a journal; it is your private digital second brain.
